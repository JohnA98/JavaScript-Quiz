# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This website has a mini JavaScript quiz as its main focus. After clicking the start button, the timer starts and the user is given multiple questions, each with 4 options. If the user guesses correctly, his or her score is increased by one. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, then 15 seconds is subtracted from the initial 60. Either way, after a right or wrong choice, the next question will appear. My motivation for this project came from me wanting to test mine my peers ability to answer JavaScript questions. Although there are only 5 questions, and they are pretty easy, this was a good start. I built this project to get familiar with the concept of local storage and setInterval() with the timer. Also the highest score is kept even upon leaving the page being my first time building a project to encompass the local storage. This quiz could be taken by a beginner just getting into JavaScript, although there isn't much value from retaking the quiz.

Each question you get wrong, it subtracts 15 seconds off of the timer before going on to the next question. Finally, after answering all the questions or if the timer runs out, you are shown your score and prompted to enter your initials.

After you input your initials, the highest score player that played in the browser has their initials and their score displayed.
